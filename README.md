# cravecupcakes-gift-card-integration
<h4>Summary</h4>

Need to integrate gift card functionality to the new site, same as the current live site.

Need to integrate GiftFly (electronic card) and eCard (physical card).

2 new pages will go under ‘Gift Cards’ main menu item. 

New pages (as dropdown under Gift Cards):

- Purchase Gift Cards<br>
  Page for purchasing electronic gift cards (current live page for reference: https://www.giftfly.com/shop/crave-cupcakes-houston-uptown-park)
- Check Gift Card Balance<br>
  Page for checking gift card balance for both eCard and GiftFly cards (current live page for reference: https://shop.cravecupcakes.com/gift_cards)

Also on the Checkout page, need 1 field to accept gift card number value and it will apply gift card balance to the order total. (example screenshot: https://ps.w.org/pw-woocommerce-gift-cards/assets/screenshot-4.png?rev=2207888)

Would also need the ability to refund balance to the gift card when an order is refunded or canceled.


<h4>APIs and Integrations</h4>
Gift card sources will be from:

- GiftFly (electronic card)
- eCard (physical card bought from in store)

APIs for GiftFly and eCard:

<h4>Deliverables checklist:</h4>

- 2 new pages: Purchase Gift Cards + Check Gift Card Balance (dropdown under Gift Cards main menu)
- Checkout page: 1 gift card field to apply to order total (from both GiftFly and eCard sources) (example screenshot: https://ps.w.org/pw-woocommerce-gift-cards/assets/screenshot-4.png?rev=2207888)
- Ability to refund gift card balance if needed
